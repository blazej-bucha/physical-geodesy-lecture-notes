# Description

The source code of lecture notes on Physical Geodesy (in Slovak).

Starting with Newton's law of gravitation, discussed are fundamental quantities 
and concepts of Physical Geodesy such as the gravitational potential, the 
gravitational vector and the equipotential surfaces.  The next chapter is 
centered around the spherical harmonic expansion of the Earth's external 
gravitational field, focusing on Legendre polynomials, Legendre functions, 
spherical harmonics and their normalization.  Next, introduced are the normal 
and the disturbing gravity field, after which the basic concepts of the geoid 
determination are discussed in the final chapter.


# Notes

* The textbook is written in LaTeX using UTF-8 encoding.

* The figures are drawn in Inkscape.

* The maps are produced using GMT.

* The numerical examples are written in Python (require NumPy, Matplotlib and 
  SciPy), C and MATLAB.

Work in progress.

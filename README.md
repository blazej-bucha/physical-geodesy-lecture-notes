# Description

The source code of lecture notes on Physical Geodesy (in Slovak).

Starting with Newton's law of gravitation, discussed are fundamental quantities 
and concepts of Physical Geodesy such as the gravitational potential, the 
gravitational vector or the equipotential surfaces.  The next chapter is 
centered around the spherical harmonic expansion of the Earth's external 
gravitational field, focusing on Legendre polynomials, Legendre functions, 
spherical harmonics and their normalization.  Next, introduced is the normal 
gravity field, after which the basic concepts of the geoid determination are 
discussed in the final chapter.


# Notes

* The textbook is written in LaTeX using UTF-8 encoding.

* Figures are drawn in Inkscape.

* Maps are produced using GMT.

* Numerical examples are written in Python (requires NumPy, Matplotlib and 
  SciPy), C and MATLAB.

Work in progress.
